in this article we are going to look how to configure raid1(Mirroring)
Mirroring : in this we will configure a storage vloume, in order to understand the Mirroring 
concept, we have to think lil differrnt , if we need do this to . we need 2 or more hardisk


if we need to confiure Mirroringr raid1 storage , we need do this to . 
we need 2 or more hardisk.
physical hardisk : 2 nos of 10GB 

if we do so, our final size of tht storage will be 10 GB .the data gonna write on the hd will mirrored (written in both the hardisk)
by this way we can avoid the data loss , if any of hardsik fails , the another hardisk will in live all our with data


environment :

centos 7
physical hardisk : 2 
size : 10GB + 10 GB 


procedure :
step 1 :

install the mdadm package :

$ yum install mdadm

first we need to examine the drive if it already got raid configration 

$mdadm -E /dev/sd[b-c]

output :
>> no block has been found 

step 2 :

Drive Partitioning for RAID(create a Partion for the drive )using fdisk 

$fdisk /dev/sdb
$fdisk /dev/sdc

once done ; check it with the  mdadm command 

$mdadm -E /dev/sd[b-c]

now check with the partions:
$mdadm -E /dev/sd[b-c]1 

>> >> no block has been found 


step 3 :

now lets create the Raid1 storage 
mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=mirror --raid-devices=2 /dev/sd[b-c]1

where,

/dev/mdo is the raid storage name (like we have in volume group /dev/vg01)
and the /dev/mdo can be anything as kernel suggestions like : /dev/md/mdo

check the raid devices type and raid array
$mdadm -E /dev/sd[b-c]
$mdadm --detail /dev/mdo


step 4 :
Creating File System on RAID Device
mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0

mount /dev/md0 /mnt/

save the raid configuration manually to ‘mdadm.conf‘ file using the below command.
mdadm --detail --scan --verbose >> /etc/mdadm.conf
