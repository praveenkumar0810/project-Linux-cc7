$docker ps 

--> no result of running docker container 
	-> do $docker logs jenkins


	->> shows a volume permission error.

Reason:

* Inside of the Jenkins container, there's a user named "jenkins" which has a Linux uid of 1000.

* You are mounting a docker volume to /var/jenkins_home which is the home directory of that user. If the directory doesn't have 1000 permissions, then the user won't be able to write/delete files, which causes the container to exit.

Resolution:

Apply 1000 permissions to your jenkins-data folder, and then restart the container.

sudo chown 1000:1000 -R ~/jenkins-data 
docker-compose up -d
